I had a horseback riding "light bulb" moment last week and I wanted to share it. Some of you have seen the evolution of this rider from a green know nottin' to a serious focused competitor to a professional on her way up with awards and judging credentials and then to the realization that there is alot more to dressage than ribbons and winning. You've seen my attitude change from "by gosh, you will!" to "can I find a better way?" to "what is this doing to your horse and you, as a horse rider". 

Last week I was at a hunter barn where a friend is helping me with the changes on Khan. I watched hunter students ride and experienced yet another light bulb moment. They were in a ring and not really focused and working but doing a lot of trotting and cantering. There were alot of smiles, at each other and at themselves when they "goofed". The horses were... well, no, not super engaged or doing shoulder in or half pass, but by gosh they were relaxed and HAPPY!!! Once again I have found myself becoming too engrossed in the result and not enjoying the journey. 

I'm going to, not always but sometimes, drop the contact, push Khan into just a happy go forward trot and remember how much I love just being around these magnificent animals. I'm going to back off, forget he has to be collected and "working" all the time and I hope to remind him of how much fun it can be too. And you know, I think I'll get a lot further that way. I hope as you ride and learn that you have "light bulb" moments also. They are what keep us going.
