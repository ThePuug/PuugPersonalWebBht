You asked sometime back what I meant by "not choosing to ride that way", regarding my lesson. I really wasn't sure how to answer you but today... it was so clear to me so thought I would share it. I have been reading and working Khan through a book called "Lessons in Lightness". I have had very little time to ride with the weather being so wet and having a grandchild here. I knew if I did not get on Khan SOON... the Amelia trail ride would not be very fun... can you relate? So yesterday I rode. He was still cold backed... bucked some at first on the lunge but we had a fairly easy ride only asking for under saddle what I had been able to work on in hand. It was a good ride. He was responsive, forward and light. What more can you ask.. but I didn't ask much.

Not just light but feathers in my hand. The reins felt like strings.

Today, he started out cold backed again... that is just his nature then we went and worked and after my gives and softening, I asked more. He again was light, responsive, forward and soft with reminders. We did some nice shoulder in... got some good beginning lengthenings, got some really good half pass and cantor, half halts, and half pass at the canter. During all this he remained soft and light and did all I asked. No fight... no excessive use of the whip... he was chewing the bit and relaxed. His trot was easy to sit because of the relaxation. Then we went back to trot and like wow!! I had several steps of what I call true self carriage. Not just light but feathers in my hand. The reins felt like strings. It was amazing and he was so round and through!

No fight... he was chewing the bit and relaxed.

Now I compare that to the lesson. He was flashy... I know that... he was covering some ground... I know that... I also know his back was like a piece of steel, his jaw was clamped on the bit and I was using the whip every other step. Can't say I think he enjoyed it. Plus I had at least 10 pounds in my hands... not heavy but certainly not light. He offered nothing... I demanded everything... I didn't enjoy it either.

He is a reflection of who I am and what I have made him into.

I rode a horse that way before and won all kinds of National awards on him, Will. He was immensely athletic and flashy and together with my strong arms and his huge stride, we won... But it was not enjoyable and I know he endured it but did not enjoy it. I want something more this time. It is not enough for me to just win anymore... I want more. I want a partnership... a conversation... a friend in my horse. I want him to love me and look forward to our time together. He is a reflection of who I am and what I have made him into. I want to like what I see when I see that reflection.

I want a partnership...... a friend in my horse

So... therefore, I CHOOSE not to ride like that but like this, above. Everyone has to soul search and decide what they want from their horse. This is what I want.
