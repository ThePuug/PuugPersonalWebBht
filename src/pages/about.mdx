## I Love Teaching

### This is my pursuit and passion

> "I started over searching for a new and different way"

How did I become interested in "Classical Dressage"? I have been riding dressage for many years and in 1994 (does that date me?) was honored to have received 4th Level Horse of the Year Award from USDF as well as High Point Hanoverian in the Nation at all levels. I did this on my long time BFF, Wilfgang. I basked in the glow of this for while but at the same time, something inside me said, "What!! Me??" Regardless of the scores I received or the awards I had, I knew, I KNEW it was ALL WRONG! I won because I had a very talented horse who was forever forgiving of me and my heavy hand and driving seat and who never made a mistake... well, almost never! So, after realizing the awards did not mean I had "made it there", in fact, I wasn't even on the right road, I started over searching for a new and different way. I purchased one of Baucher's books and tried to learn from that. I practiced flexions and went back to the walk for 6 months so that I would relearn what "feel" was, what softness was. But I was alone and though I had some success, I did not know how to put it together.

> "Then I attended a John Lyons clinic where I saw the partnership, understanding and softness that I so searched for."

I read an article by an internationally acclaimed competition rider and I went "yes!". She talked about softness and release and... and... and... So I signed up for a clinic that was in my area. I was so excited... someone to tell me where to go with the new feel I had acquired. Someone to help guide me on. Well, after 20 minutes of my $200 ride, I turned to her, said, "Thank you for the lesson" and excused myself. I spent the next hour telling my horse how sorry I was that I had taken so much contact and would not release and drove... drove... drove... him forward into a rigid unforgiving hand. So, at this point, I was totally disheartened, wondering if I was so far off course. 

Then I attended a John Lyons clinic where I saw the partnership, understanding and softness that I so searched for. I rode in a clinic with him and had 2 major good things happen. One, he invited me to ride Zip, his treasured mount, early one morning when I was up practicing what we had learned the other day. What an eye opener that was! The horse responded to my thoughts before I even gave the aid, he was so soft, so up, ...wow! Anyway, On the last day of the 3 day clinic, my horse developed a strained suspensory, so John invited me to stand by his side the entire day and he instructed one horse after another, had me feel the rein and educated me. It was awesome. I knew that softness could happen... I just needed to continue trying.

## Softness COULD happen

### I just needed to continue trying

But I loved dressage... So for the next several years, I read... and read and read... and tried so hard. I learned that what I wanted was the French method, that the jaw was the essential missing ingredient in my riding. I began to pass this on to the students that I taught. I learned so much from Racinet's three books and applied and taught what I was learning. I was ridiculed by many existing dressage riders when I would ask for "flexions". I was told that my horses were not forward enough, that I must be sending them into the bit and they must be "long and low". I often questioned my path for surely I have sooo much to learn and they... they are successful. But it came back to the awards and the wrongness of it all. I became an "L" judge and was then told HOW I must score and what I MUST reward and what I MUST punish even when it went against all I have learned in the last few years. So I gave up judging and went back to learning.

> "I continue searching for knowledge and that elusive feel of softness."

And... I continue searching for knowledge and that elusive feel of softness. Sometimes I think I am on the right path and other times I wonder how I can be so ineffective? What am I doing wrong? I am convinced, to the inner parts of my being, that this is correct but I have so many stumbling blocks... so... I want to audit... I want to learn... and I want to be better! Youth is not on my side anymore. My years left in serious riding are growing less and less. So I must make the time I have work best for me. I must learn all I can and I must teach all who I can.

I will forever be grateful to Bruno Gonzalez and Tina Veder of Baroque Equestrian Games and Institute for guiding me on my current path of classical training. I continue to be amazed at the depth of knowledge Bruno has and his level of understanding and horsemanship. I will forever be his student with always more to learn.

> "It is a passion of mine to pass on what I have struggled for years to find."

I currently coach the Longwood University Dressage Team (a small new team) but I am teaching them to release, to ask for self-carriage and to stop driving, to spend time walking and learning how to have a 2 sided conversation with their horse. It is a passion of mine to pass on what I have struggled for years to find. I love teaching... I want my students to realize they do not HAVE to ride like that... they can choose a different approach and be a more compassionate, sensitive rider for it. So, did you ask for all that? ...no, but it is spilling out of me in my desire to learn more. I am so ready.
