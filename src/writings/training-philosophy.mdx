My philosophy of training? That is difficult to explain for it is not just a set of words or rhetoric that spills out. It is about the commitments and standards that I set for myself. So let me explain some of my commitments.

First… I am totally committed to training in the classical manner and teachings of the Masters of Old. I especially adhere to the teachings of la Gueriniere and William Cavendish, the Duke of Newcastle. I am committed to supporting the Baroque Equestrian Games and Institute and to continue to train under Bruno Gonzalez and Tina Veder.

Maximize the horse without destroying the spirit

I believe every horse is an individual to be respected and understood. It is my job to maximize that horse without destroying his spirit. I believe he has his own mind and will and I endeavor to join with him in a partnership where we work together.

I am committed to sharing and teaching what knowledge I have learned so that others can learn more easily and can in turn teach others. This is my passion.

My pursuit is to be an eternal student, always open to learning and understanding the horse and training more deeply. I have chosen to pursue this under the guidance of Bruno Gonzalez, to me, a Master Horseman of his own right.

So be it my philosophy or my commitments or my passion and pursuit…. This is how I approach my horsemanship. Let me finish with something that Bruno Gonzalez wrote:

> Classical Horsemanship is not a building, or a type of horse or even a way of riding (riding with light contact). The soul of Classical Horsemanship is a personal choice that a rider should make every day. Different situations are presented when schooling a horse and a choice should be made to pursuit a beautiful artistic picture of effortless movement and graceful expression.

> Classical Horsemanship is a personal choice that a rider should make every day

> As important as the correct application of the theory is, it is even more important to promote a way of thinking that will bring about the desirable actions. Too often, correct natural actions from the rider are halted because of over thinking and pondering upon theory. At times the example is not going to be technically correct, but as long as the spirit of Classical Horsemanship is promoted then I believe we will help riders come to the way thinking that would encourage correct theory. Only from the love of the horse can this way of thinking blossom. -- Bruno Gonzalez 2013
