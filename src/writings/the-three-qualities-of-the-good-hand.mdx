The good hand : light, gentle and firm by La Guérinière, 1733.

The good hand has three qualities : it is light, gentle and firm.

The light hand is the one that doesn’t feel any pressure from the bit on the bars.

The gentle hand is the one that feels a light effect of the bit without allowing much support.

And the firm hand is the one that holds the horse in a full support.

It is an artful skill to be able to use in a correct fashion these three different movements of the hand, according to the nature of the mouth of each horse ; without forcing too much, nor releasing at once the true support of the mouth. That is to say, after giving with the hand, which is the action of the light hand, one has to hold it gently, to seek and feel in the hand, little by little, the support of the bit ; this is to have a gentle hand. One then resist more and more, holding the horse in a stronger support, which is the firm hand : and then one soften, and then one diminishes the feeling of the bit unto the hand, before switching to the light hand. For the gentle hand has to always be preceding and following the effect of the firm hand, and one should never give with the hand all at once, neither shall one hold it firmly suddenly ; one would upset the mouth of the horse and make him toss his head.
